??? tip "Writing nuclei templates is useful?"

	Performing security assessment of the application is time-consuming, it's always better and time saver to automate the steps when possible. Once you found a security vulnerability, you can prepare a nuclei template by defining the required HTTP request to reproduce the issue and simply test the same vulnerability across multiple hosts with ease, worth mentioning ==you write the template for once and use forever==, as you don't need to manually test that specific vulnerability anymore.

	Here are few examples from the community making use of templates to automate the security findings.
